NOTE:
	TODOs are divided in three parts: TO-BE-DONE, DONE and DONE-RECHECK.
	When a TODO item has been completed it should be moved to DONE or
	DONE-RECHECK, if it needs further checking.
	In DONE and DONE-RECHECK status a date or a release version tag should
	be added too.

  This approach should handle cross-compilation cases

DONE-RECHECK:

* Fix the long-C++ names demangling (> 1 numbers entries)

* Rearrange the BFD related code

DONE:
