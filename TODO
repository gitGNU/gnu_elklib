NOTE:
        TODOs are divided in three parts: TO-BE-DONE, DONE and DONE-RECHECK.

        TODOs in TO-BE-DONE are ordered in a least-to-last important order.
        Take in charge whatever TODO you like to complete but remember that
        the least important are probably the blocking ones ... so they should
        be completed first ...

        When a TODO in TO-BE-DONE has been completed it must be moved to DONE
        or DONE-RECHECK if it needs further checking.

        In DONE and DONE-RECHECK a date or a release version (the same that
        the ChangeLog shows) number should be added too (in order to remember
        when that TODO has been declared completed ...

TO-BE-DONE:
* We should use AC_CHECK_TOOL instead of AC_PATH_PROG machineries that we have
  This approach should handle cross-compilation cases.

DONE-RECHECK:
